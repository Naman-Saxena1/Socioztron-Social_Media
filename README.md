## You are welcome to contribute to this project 
1. Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
2. Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
3. Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
4. If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
5. Create a new branch to work on! Branch from development branch.
6. Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
7. Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
8. Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
9. From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's development branch.
10. Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
11. And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
